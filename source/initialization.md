<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

To get started with Apollo and Angular, install the `apollo-client` npm package, the `angular2-apollo` integration package, and the `graphql-tag` library for constructing query documents:

```bash
npm install apollo-client angular2-apollo graphql-tag --save
```

<h2 id="typescript">TypeScript</h2>

Those libraries require few additional type declarations:

```bash
npm install @types/{chai,es6-shim,isomorphic-fetch,node} typed-graphql
```

> Since v0.8 you don't have to install `@types/es6-shim`. You can **skip [*ES2015* section](#typescript-es2015)**.

<h3 id="typescript-es2015">ES2015</h3>

TypeScript 2.0 comes with a set of predefined type declarations.
If you're using one of them that brings ES2015 (ES6) you should disable it, because `@types/es6-shim` will cause an issue with multiple types definitons.

It's easy, just replace `es6`, `es2015` or similar options from `compilerOptions.lib` for `es5`.

<h3 id="typescript-graphql">GraphQL</h3>

Since `typed-graphql` is not a package under `@types` scope, it's not visible by TypeScript compiler.

There are two ways of changing this.

First approach would be to include `node_modules/typed-graphql/graphql.d.ts` to your project. Take a look at [TypeScript documenation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

Second way would be to add global reference to one of files.

```ts
/// <reference types="typed-graphql" />
```

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

To get started using Apollo, we need to create an `ApolloClient` and use `ApolloModule`. `ApolloClient` serves as a central store of query result data which caches and distributes the results of our queries. `ApolloModule` wires that client into your application.

<h3 id="creating-client">Creating a client</h3>

To get started, create an [`ApolloClient`](/core/apollo-client-api.html#constructor) instance and point it at your GraphQL server:

```ts
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

// by default, this client will send queries to `/graphql` (relative to the URL of your app)
const client = new ApolloClient();
```

The client takes a variety of [options](/core/apollo-client-api.html#constructor), but in particular, if you want to change the URL of the GraphQL server, you can pass in a custom [`NetworkInterface`](/core/apollo-client-api.html#NetworkInterface):

```ts
import ApolloClient, { createNetworkInterface } from 'apollo-client';

// by default, this client will send queries to `/graphql` (relative to the URL of your app)
const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface: createNetworkInterface({
    uri: 'http://my-api.grapql.com'
  }),
});
```

The other options control the behavior of the client, and we'll see examples of their use throughout this guide.

**Angular Modules**, also known as **NgModules**, are the powerful new way to organize and bootstrap your Angular application.

<h3 id="providing-apollomodule">Providing ApolloModule</h3>

To connect your client instance to your app, use the `ApolloModule.withClient`.

```ts
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';
import { ApolloModule } from 'angular2-apollo';

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule  } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Create the client as outlined above
const client = new ApolloClient();

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ApolloModule.withClient(client)
  ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
class AppModule {}

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```
